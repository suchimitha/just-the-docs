# Breadwinner API for Xero
{: .fs-9 }


---

## Introduction
Breadwinner global API used to make request to Xero. Request & responses are defined in such a way that, you can make use of them and form the required things for the request and also to handle the response.

We have created two Handlers, one is for Request and another is for Response. They are named as RequestObject and ResponseObject respectively.

Currently, we are providing API to create, update and fetch Xero Contacts, Invoices, Bills, and Purchase Orders from Salesforce to Xero.

Breadwinner Provides Apex classes and methods. Users can use these, in their own custom Apex code to perform there need. The following are the class and methods.

## BreadwinnerAPI Class 
This is a global class where you can access RequestObject and ResponseObject.

- <b>Call()</b><br/>
This is a global method which will return list of Customers or Invoices in the form of [BreadwinnerAPI.ResponseObject]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/response.md %}). It takes two parameters.

> 1. <b>Action</b>: Used to define the type of action that needs to be performed.<br/>
E.g : createCustomer, createInvoice,â€¦ see [List of actions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/request.md %})

>  2. <b>Request</b>: An instance of [RequestObject]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/request.md %}) is accepted.<br/>
E.g :  BreadwinnerAPI.RequestObject request = new BreadwinnerAPI.RequestObject();
